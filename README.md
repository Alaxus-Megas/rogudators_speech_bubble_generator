I have taken this plugin to the next level! This upgraded version now includes a complete set of tools for comic artists: Thought Bubbles (cloud shape), Shout Bubbles (spiky shape), and a new Sharp Square mode for a classic look.

Beyond the shapes, I've implemented a Layered Opacity system, allowing you to independently control the transparency of the text, the bubble background, and the outline. The math behind the vectors has been optimized for perfect centering and more natural-looking tails.
